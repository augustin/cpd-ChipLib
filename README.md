ChipLib
==================
This library was originally written because no suitable FOSS library for reading VLSI chips was readily available -- all the readers were tied into a VLSI library.
It can only read CIF files (Caltech Intermediate Format), is somewhat messy, and requires Qt (but it shouldn't be too hard to remove that dependency.)
